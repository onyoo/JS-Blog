This is a basic blog app.

Users can log-in via their LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, or Twitter accounts.

Once logged-in users can create, edit or delete their posts. Commenting, and
replying to comments is also possible.

Creating posts or comments/replies is done via AJAX request. The app makes use
of Rails USJ to do this.
